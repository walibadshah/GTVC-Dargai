<h2> Principal Message   </h2>  <br />

Today, Pakistan is the most dynamic and one of the youngest economies across the world. It is currently the most attractive destination for foreign investments and to cater for the same we need trained, educated and a specialized workforce in diverse sectors. This will not only address the current manpower needs, but will also lead to educated, skilled and employed youth responsible for building a strong nation.
Hence, the advent of vocational trainings came into existence with special focus to specifically empower youth who lacked the resources, skills and opportunities by providing them technical vocational education and trainings (TVET). The TVETs not only are working towards impeding child labor but are also creating skilled workforce by providing them ample opportunities to lead a respectful and independent life contributing towards a subsistence economy.

The Prophet (PBUH) said “Efforts come from me and its fulfillment from Allah: let’s try our best and do whatever we can within our capacity. Let’s put our trust in “God help those who help themselves”.

I look forward to welcoming you to the Government Technical & Vocational Centre Dargai Malakand.
